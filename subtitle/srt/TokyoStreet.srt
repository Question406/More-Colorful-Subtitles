1
00:00:37,406 --> 00:00:39,305
Look at the stars

2
00:00:39,511 --> 00:00:44,510
Look how they shine for you

3
00:00:44,706 --> 00:00:49,305
And everything you do

4
00:00:49,515 --> 00:00:52,014
Yeah they were all yellow

5
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,309
I came along

6
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:59,500
I wrote a song for you

7
00:00:59,716 --> 00:01:04,515
And all the things you do

8
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:09,210
And it was called yellow

9
00:01:09,412 --> 00:01:14,111
So then I took my turn

10
00:01:14,315 --> 00:01:19,114
Oh what a thing to have done

11
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:27,299
And it was all yellow

12
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,218
Your skin

13
00:01:29,412 --> 00:01:32,111
Oh yeah your skin and bones

14
00:01:32,315 --> 00:01:37,014
Turn into something beautiful

15
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,999
You know you know I love you so

16
00:01:45,213 --> 00:01:53,212
You know I love you so

17
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,299
I swam across

18
00:02:09,513 --> 00:02:14,912
I jumped across for you

19
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:20,101
Oh what a thing to do

20
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:22,810
′Cause you were all yellow

21
00:02:23,004 --> 00:02:24,603
I drew a line

22
00:02:24,807 --> 00:02:30,006
I drew a line for you

23
00:02:30,206 --> 00:02:34,805
Oh what a thing to do

24
00:02:35,017 --> 00:02:42,816
And it was all yellow

25
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,209
Your skin

26
00:02:45,405 --> 00:02:47,604
Oh yeah your skin and bones

27
00:02:47,808 --> 00:02:52,607
Turn into something beautiful

28
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:55,108
And you know

29
00:02:55,318 --> 00:03:00,417
For you I had bleed myself dry

30
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:08,608
For you I had bleed myself dry

31
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:25,301
It is true
