1
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:17,954
Every day, in a movie

2
00:00:17,954 --> 00:00:22,169
in a book or in a drama, I feel love

3
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,653
Um- I learn about love

4
00:00:26,853 --> 00:00:29,271
My heart keeps beating as if it’s my own story

5
00:00:29,271 --> 00:00:33,893
Makes my heart pound and swell with hope

6
00:00:33,893 --> 00:00:38,549
Um- I want to know so bad

7
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:40,739
Ooh Maybe someday

8
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,599
Could it happen to me, too

9
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,899
When will it be? Who will it be?

10
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,778
I wanna know How it could be as sweet as candy

11
00:00:51,779 --> 00:00:54,544
I wanna know How it’s like flying in the sky

12
00:00:54,744 --> 00:00:56,827
I wanna know know know know

13
00:00:56,828 --> 00:01:00,000
What is love? What love feels like

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,079
I wanna know How it keeps you smiling all day

15
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:05,939
I wanna know How the whole world turns beautiful

16
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,897
I wanna know know know know

17
00:01:07,897 --> 00:01:12,348
What is love? Will love come to me someday?

18
00:01:12,349 --> 00:01:14,119
Just imagining all this

19
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,819
Just thinking about it almost makes my heart to burst

20
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:23,329
Um- How good it feels

21
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:25,599
If, one day, for real

22
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:30,319
Love does come to me, I might just cry

23
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,738
Um- I really want to know how it feels

24
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:37,085
Ooh Maybe someday

25
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:41,075
Could it happen to me, too

26
00:01:41,075 --> 00:01:45,222
When will it be? Who will it be?

27
00:01:45,222 --> 00:01:48,198
I wanna know How it could be as sweet as candy

28

35
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Where in the world are you right now

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,872
Just when will we get to meet each other

37
00:02:13,872 --> 00:02:16,810
When and how might our relationship start

38
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,469
Don’t know right now, but somehow I feel

39
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:22,293
that it will be real good

40
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:25,099
Better than any movie or drama

41
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:27,793
The greatest love will come, my gut instinct is always right

42
00:02:27,793 --> 00:02:31,116
C’mon, show yourself, I’m all set Ready!
