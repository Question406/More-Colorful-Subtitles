1
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,620
I crumbled before your eyes

2
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,359
Hit rock bottom and sunk deeper

3
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:23,899
To grab onto the last bit of hope

4
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:27,839
I’ve tried to reach out with both of my hands

5
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,859
Again in this dark place, light up the sky

6
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,740
While looking into your eyes, I’ll kiss you goodbye

7
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,000
Laugh all you want while you still can

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,299
Because it’s about to be your turn 1, 2, 3

9
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,640
Ha how you like that?

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,379
You gon’ like that that that that that

11
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:51,140
How you like that?

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,279
How you like that that that that that

13
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:00,079
Now look at you now look at me

14
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,320
Look at you now look at me

How you like that

19
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,500
Your girl need it all and that’s a hundred

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,019
10 out of 10 I want what’s mine

21
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:17,039
Karma come and get some

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,179
I feel bad but there’s nothing I can do

23
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,119
Whats up I’m right back

24
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,899
Cock back the trigger

25
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:24,099
Plain Jane get hijacked

26
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:27,140
Don’t like me? Then tell me how you like that

27
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,920
In this even darker place shine like the stars

28
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,840
With a smile on my face I’ll kiss you goodbye

29
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,759
Laugh all you want while you still can

30
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:40,259
Because it’s about to be your turn 1, 2, 3

31
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,579
Ha how you like that?

32

00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,960
How you like that?

34
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,420
How you like that that that that that

35
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,180
Now look at you now look at me

36
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,319
Look at you now look at me

How you like that

41
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:15,859
The day I fell without my wings

42
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,560
Those dark days where I was trapped

43
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,840
You should’ve ended me when you had the chance

44
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,420
Look up in the sky it’s a bird it’s a plane

45
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,199
BLACKPINK!

46
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,299

47
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,219

How you like that
