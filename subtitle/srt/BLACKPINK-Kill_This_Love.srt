1
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,000
After a sweet Hi there’s always a bitter Bye

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,640
After every crazy High there’s a Price you have to pay

3
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,280
There’s no answer to this Test I’ll always fall for it Yes

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,100
I’m a slave to my emotions

5
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,199
Screw this heartless love

6
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:32,159
Here I come kick in the door

7
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,979
Give me the strongest one

8
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:35,699

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,019
Give me more give me some more

10
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:38,839
Cling onto the edge of the cliff if you want

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,479
With just one word you’re like starstruck again

12
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:42,619
That warm nervous feeling, extreme excitement

13
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:44,899
Felt like heaven but you might not get in it

14
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:48,280
Look at me Look at you who will be in more pain?

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,200
You smart like who? You are

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,379
If you cry tears of blood from both eyes

17
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:58,780
So sorry like who? You are

18
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:04,920
What should I do, I can’t stand myself being so weak

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,619
While I force myself to cover my eyes

20
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:12,619
I need to bring an end to this love

21
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,560

32
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,439

33
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:53,840
So what so what

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,400

00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,599
While I force myself to hide my tears

39
